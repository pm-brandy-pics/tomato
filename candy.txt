This was years ago, when I was a much younger lass in my twenties. I lived right by a forest that had a bunch of hiking trails through it, and I loved to take my dog for a walk there at night to look at the stars, listen to the river, get wicked baked, etc. <br>You could expect other people there, it was a park after all, but usually it was pretty empty.

So for reference, I was about 100lbs soaking wet and my dog was a 10lb Mini Pin, so not exactly a threat to anyone. <br> I also didn't have my cell on me because I was dumb. It was about 11pm on a warm Tuesday night and we were just lazing in one of the little alcoves by the riverbank I like to rest at and enjoy the fireflies and whatnot. Then all of a sudden I hear this horrible scream. My dog starts barking like crazy and I freak out, but then I think 'that was probably a rabbit' because they scream like creepily humanlike. <br> My dog calms down and I go back to stargazing and then the scream happens again but louder. And then twice more.

My dog is growling and trying to hide behind me and then I hear this noise like a TRex is running through the forest - big loud stomps and branches breaking and shit. <br> So now I think a girl is being chased and I feel awful because I don't have my cell on me. It gets closer and my dog and I just hunker down hoping we can't be seen from the path and I can see one of the trees above us shake. It felt like that scene from LOTR with the hobbits under the tree roots. <br> The noise and stomping go right past me but I don't see anything on the path. I stay there for a while, don't hear anything else and eventually go home. There's a lot of broken branches on the path and it smelled like wood smoke, but no other clues. <br>

If my dog hadn't been there being so visibly freaked out, I would assume it was a dream. She would never go down that specific path again either.
